And we will honor our business relationships with other companies that restrict the sharing of personal information with others. We will give you additional disclosures or obtain your authorization when required by applicable law.</p>

    <p>We may obtain information to provide you products and services you have requested, to service your membership and as we deem appropriate, to determine your eligibility for products or services. We may collect identification, contact, transaction and experience information from applications, and from transactions with us.

    <h4>Gramm Leach Bliley Act</h4>

    <h4>Our security procedures</h4>

    <p>We comply fully with the Gramm Leach Bliley Act which was designed to protect the confidentiality of customers' nonpublic personal information and to communicate applicable provisions of such privacy program with customers.</p>

    <h4>Online information and collection</h4>

    <p>You can visit us on the web without revealing any additional information about yourself, including your email address. In this case, our web servers only collect the name of the domain you used to access the Internet, such as "aol.com" or "msn.com," and the website you came from.</p>

    <p>We also monitor site performance to make the site easier and more convenient to use. We may aggregate statistics that we gather about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and services, and provide these statistics to third parties.

We, along with thousands of other websites, use cookies to enhance your web viewing experience and to measure your website usage. With the help of cookies, we may present you with customized offerings or content that may be of interest to you.

You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. Please note however, that by not accepting cookies, you may limit the functionality we can provide to you when you visit our site.</p>
